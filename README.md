# BeesNest_MonitoringSystem
Bees nest light intensity, humidity, temperature, and in-out activities monitoring system based on DHT22, LDR, and TCRT5000 sensors that controlled by 3 integrated Arduino Uno and 1 RaspberryPi.

This capstone project, as part of my undergraduate thesis, was successfully carried out and implemented in the academic paper entitled [Determination of Productivity, Yield and Bioactivity of Propolis Extract Produced by Tetragonula spp. Cultivated in Modular Tetragonula Hives](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e17304)
